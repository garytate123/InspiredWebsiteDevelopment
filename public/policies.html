Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.
                Cookies can be "First Party", i.e. set by us, or "Third Party" – set by another company to perform the function, for example, Google Analytics. 
              </p>
              <h1>How can I prevent Cookies from being used?</h1>
              <p>

You can find out how to do this for your particular browser by clicking "help" on your browser's menu or by visiting http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html. 
                However, please be aware that should you choose to disable cookies it may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website and some of the websites may fail to work.  
                If you do not consent to Advertising cookies, you may be served the same adverts repeatedly and we won’t be able to serve you adverts that are personally relevant to you.

              <h1>Use of Cookies by Us</h1>
              <p>

                We may also allow cookies to be set by several independent measurement and research companies. These companies read and write their own cookies onto your devices. For example, these cookies are used to track the adverts and keep count of the number of times that each advert is viewed by users. We use this type of information to help improve the services the website provides to you.
                If we do want to collect personally identifiable information through any of the websites, we will be upfront about this.
